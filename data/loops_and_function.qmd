## Part 1

Task 1

```{r}
weekdays <- c("Monday","Tuesday",
              "Wednesday","Thursday",
              "Friday","Saturday","Sunday"
              )
transect <- c("Transect A","Transect B","Transect C")

#Create a matrix

out_matrix <- matrix(nrow = length(weekdays),ncol = length(transect))


for (i in seq_along(weekdays)){
  for(j in seq_along(transect)){
    out_matrix[i,j] <- paste(weekdays[i],
                             "-",transect[j])
  }
}
```

Task 2

```{r}
force <- function(mass,acceleration){
  f = mass*acceleration
  print(paste("The resulting force is",f,"Newtons."))
}

force(10,2)
```

Task 3

```{r}
